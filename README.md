# X-Wing-IIR-Filltering
For the 3rd and final assessment of the Digital SIgnal Processing course we were called to design and implement an IIR Filter to filter in real time a "noisy" real world problem. An accelerometer was chosen and we commenced on filtering high frequency turbulence during pitch and roll measurements.

## The UI !!

![jUST A SCREENCAPTURE :) ](GIF.gif)
You can of course see the UI and the program in a working order on the youtube link posted!!! Feel free to try it on your own.

# Circuitry

> Really simple!! Just grab an Arduino that has been sitting on your drawer for too long

> Some dupont cables. Or any type of cables you have!

> An ADXL335 Accelerometer.
